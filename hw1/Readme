Purpose: Calculate the area, perimeter of a given rectangle,
         as well as report whether or not given rectangle
         is or is not a square.

List of Files:
 - Rectangle.h   - header file with declaration of the class
       	           "rectangle."
 - Rectangle.cpp - definition of functions within rectangle
                   class.
 - rectangleTester.cpp - contains main. client will interact
                         with this file. 

Compiling: type " make rectangleTester "  OR
           type " g++ -o rectangle.o -c rectangle.cpp "
                " g++ -o rectangleTester.o -c rectangleTester.cpp "
                " g++ -o rectangleTester rectangle.o rectangleTester.o "

Data structure: basic variable storage. private data stored in class.

Algorithm: 

1. Default constructor creates unit rectangle. 
2. User inputs length and width of rectangle. Setter functions
   store as private data in class. 
3. Perimeter, area and isSquare functions defined in implementation 
   file.
4. Helper function in main is passed instance of rectangle and a 
   number, couts output along with calculated perimeter and area.
